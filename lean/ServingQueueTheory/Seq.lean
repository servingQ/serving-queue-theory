# seQ: the serving-deployment language, formally

seQ is the language in which a serving deployment is a program: a
*deployment* of memory pools and stages, a *workload*, and a *route* that
every session follows (seQ `docs/language.md`; the Rust interpreter, crate `seq-lang`, is the
reference implementation, this module is the formal one; see `research/seq.md`). This
module formalises:

* the syntax of routes (`Route Env V`) and the well-formedness condition
  under which the semantics is well defined (every loop body runs a stage:
  `Route.wf`), with the surface syntax `[route| … ]` inside Lean;
* the rates of the stage kinds: a serial stage serves its head at rate 1,
  a shared stage splits `φ(n)` equally (`sharedRate_sum`: the shares add up
  to the capacity), an external stage serves everyone at rate 1;
* the semantics of one memory pool (`PoolState`, `Step`): the queue,
  admission with eviction of cached prefixes (the guard counts allocated
  units only, so a cached prefix never blocks), release with caching of
  `ℓ ≤ c` units, dropping a prefix and leaving. The memory invariant
  `allocated + cached ≤ capacity` is preserved by every step
  (`Step.invariant`), as is the non-negativity of every entry
  (`Step.nonneg`).

Key theorems: `sharedRate_sum`, `total_evictUntil_le`, `Step.invariant`,
`Step.nonneg`, `admit_guard_units_only`.

/-! ## Syntax -/

/-- Session attributes: the workload's turn attributes and the hit
indicator, as a real vector indexed by attribute slot. -/
abbrev Attr := ℕ → ℝ

/-- Stage kinds (Definition L1:def:syntax; `step` is the iterating engine
of the colocated replica, Rust `stage s : step { budget; cost }`). -/
inductive StageKind
  /-- one job at a time, in arrival order, at rate 1 (a prefill instance) -/
  | serial
  /-- every job at once, throughput `φ n` split equally (decode, a link) -/
  | shared (φ : ℕ → ℝ)
  /-- every job on its own at rate 1, no waiting (a tool call) -/
  | external
  /-- an engine that runs iterations of `budget` tokens (chunked prefill
  with continuous batching) -/
  | step (budget : ℝ)

/-- How a job runs at a stage: plain work at rate 1 (`fifo`, `ps`,
`delay`), or prefill / decode tokens at a `step` stage. -/
inductive Mode
  | plain
  | prefill
  | decode
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- One pool of a `hold`: the pool, the units allocated, and optionally the
units that must fit for the admission (`fits`, e.g. the whole prompt while
only its first chunk is allocated). -/
abbrev HoldPool (Env V : Type) := ℕ × (Env → V) × Option (Env → V)

/-- Routes: the statements a session executes, over an environment type
`Env` (what an expression may read: the session's attributes, and in the
executable semantics also observables such as the cache and the engine's
budget) and a value type `V` (`ℝ` for the paper's models, `ℕ` for the
executable semantics on the step clock). Every statement carries its
continuation `k`.

* `hold ps reuse body cache k` waits until every pool of `ps` has room,
  consumes the session's own cached prefix (at most `reuse` of it; the rest
  stays cached, unusable, until evicted), allocates, runs `body` holding
  the units, releases them keeping `cache` units cached, and continues
  with `k` (the scoped form of the lecture's `admit`/`free`);
* `run s mode w g k` joins stage `s` with `w` units of work; `g` is the pool
  whose hold the job grows as it advances (`growing`);
* `set`, `observe` assign an attribute and record a measurement. -/

/-! ## Surface syntax inside Lean

seQ programs can be written in their own syntax inside Lean: a syntax
category `route` with the statements of the language, elaborated by
macros into the `Route` inductive. No hand-written lexer or parser is
needed on the formal side (the Rust crate keeps its own parser for the
simulator's CLI); the same term is the object of the proofs. Expressions
are ordinary Lean terms in the environment `x`. -/
