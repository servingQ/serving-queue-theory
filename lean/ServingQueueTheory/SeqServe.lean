# Serving order of a step engine: admission order is decode-first

A decode-first replica serves prefill "from the token budget the decode
batch leaves": decoding turns first, prefill after. vLLM
v1 serves its running requests in admission order (`scheduler.py`,
`running` list) and gives each `min(remaining, budget left)` tokens. The
two rules coincide whenever every decoding resident precedes every
prefilling one. This module proves that a greedy step preserves that
shape when a prefill may take the whole budget left (no per-request chunk
cap), so that with FIFO admission (new residents are prefilling and join
at the end) admission order *is* decode-first; and that a per-request
chunk cap (`long_prefill_token_threshold`) breaks it.

A resident is its remaining prefill work, `0` for a decoding one. One
greedy step (`serve`) hands a decoding resident one token and a
prefilling one `min(r, left)` (or `min(r, c, left)` with a cap `c`).

Key theorems: `serve_preserves_shape`, `decodeFirst_eq_self`,
`serve_eq_decode_first`, `chunk_cap_breaks_shape`.
