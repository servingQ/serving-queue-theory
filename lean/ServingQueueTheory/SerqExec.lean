# serQ: an executable semantics

`Serq.lean` gives the syntax of serQ (`Route Env V`) and the relational
semantics of one memory pool (`Step`, with the memory invariant). This
module gives an *executable* semantics of the fragment that production
schedulers are written in: values are natural numbers (tokens), time is
the clock of a `step` engine (one iteration per tick), and the deployment
is a list of pools plus the engine (stage 0); every other stage is a
delay. The workload is data (`Workload`): each session's preset
attributes and, optionally, its turns, which a `turn` statement reads in
order (as serQ reads explicit sessions of its IR, or an ordered trace).

* **Pools** allocate in blocks, keep released prefixes as cache entries
  (per session, tail blocks evicted first, least recently released entry
  first, ties by release order), admit the head of their queue when every
  pool of its hold has room for its `fits` units (allocated units never
  count the cache), consume at most `reuse` of the own prefix (the rest
  stays cached, dead, with its age), and on a failed growth preempt the
  most recently admitted holder, whose hold is released (its computed
  prefix cached) and re-queued at the head. A pool marked `viaEngine`
  (`admit via engine`) is admitted by the engine at the start of an
  iteration, with the budget its residents leave (`budgetLeft`), and not
  in an iteration that preempted.
* **The engine** hands its budget to its residents in admission order, one
  token to a decoding job and up to `chunk` to a prefilling one, grows the
  holds of `growing` jobs before the tokens are committed, then admits.

These are the rules of serQ `src/sim.rs`, which reproduces the real vLLM
v1 scheduler step for step (serQ `docs/language.md` §7). The vLLM
scheduler scenarios of serQ `tools/oracle/` are then theorems about serQ
programs (`SerqOracle.lean`), checked by evaluation in the kernel.

Key definitions: `Exec.Deployment`, `Exec.Workload`, `Exec.Machine`,
`Exec.tick`, `Exec.run`, `Exec.runW`.
Key theorems: `Exec.makeRoom_used` (eviction never touches the allocation),
`Exec.makeRoom_room` (the eviction loop makes the room it is asked for, or
empties the cache).
