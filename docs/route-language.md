# ROUTE: a language for the formal verification and simulation of LLM serving systems

Status: 2026-09-27 (second pass the same day). Reference implementation
`route/` (Rust: parser, interpreter, CLI), formal model
`lean/ServingQueueTheory/Route.lean` (syntax `Route Env V`, pool semantics,
memory invariant, the two replicas as programs, surface syntax),
`RouteExec.lean` (an executable semantics of the pool and step-engine
fragment), `RouteOracle.lean` (the vLLM scheduler scenarios as theorems,
generated), `RouteServe.lean` (serving order of a step engine); programs
`route/programs/*.route`; checks `make route`, `make lean` and `make sim`
(the cross-checks live in `libqueuingsim/tests/route_*.rs`). The review of the first version
against vLLM, the design decisions and the tooling survey are in
`docs/route-review.md`.

## 1. What ROUTE is for

A serving deployment is a program. The program names the resources of the
deployment (memory pools, stages), says how sessions arrive and how a
session's turns evolve (the workload), and gives the path every session
takes through the resources (the route). One program has three uses:

1. **Simulation.** `route run prog.route` executes it as a discrete-event
   simulation and reports time averages, per-observation statistics and
   per-turn records. `libqueuingsim` now runs ROUTE programs next to its
   hand-written models (Section 6).
2. **Formal verification.** The same syntax is an inductive type in Lean
   with an operational semantics; properties of the language (the memory
   invariant of every pool, the shares of a processor-sharing stage) and
   of particular programs (well-formedness of the paper's replica) are
   theorems. Programs can be written in ROUTE's own syntax inside Lean
   (`[route| ... ]`).
3. **Specification of production systems.** vLLM v1's engine is a
   50-line program (`programs/vllm.route`, `vllm_replay.route`). It
   reproduces the real scheduler request for request: on six
   deterministic scenarios (also on the real A100 engine, and as Lean
   theorems) and on the full 333-session agent trace (3 321 requests,
   every first-token time and cached-token count identical to the real
   scheduler driven by the same clock). With the cost model measured on
   the A100 it predicts the measured runs' hit rates within 1–6 points,
   including where the replica collapses (Section 8).

The organising idea, unchanged from the lecture: a deployment does four
things to a request: makes it **wait for a resource**, **runs** it on a
stage, **frees** the resource (possibly keeping a prefix cached), and
**sends it somewhere next**. v2 makes the first three one scoped
statement (`hold`), generalises "resource" so that KV memory, request
slots and offload tiers are the same kind of object (a pool), and adds
the one stage kind the lecture could not express: the colocated engine
that prefills in the compute its decode step leaves (`step`).

```

Expressions: arithmetic, comparisons (0/1), `&&`, `||`, `!`, `c ? a : b`,
`~exp(mean)`, `~det(x)`, `~uniform(lo,hi)`, `~erlang(k,mean)`,

`est_rho(s)`, `est_wait(s)`; context variables `now`, `size`, `age`,
`last`, `queued` (eviction keys and spill predicates), `n` (ps
capacity), `ntok`, `ndec`, `npre`, `nres`, `kvb`, `kvp`, `attn` (step budget
and cost; `attn = Σ n (K + n/2)` over the prefill chunks, `K` the position
before the chunk). A name may not be both a `let` constant and a session
attribute (the linker rejects it: an attribute would shadow the constant,
and a stage's cost, which has no session, would read it as undefined). Built-in session attributes: `serial`, `turn_no`, `cached` (the
prefix consumed at the last admission), and with a trace `new`, `out`,
`think`, `more`, `forced`. Every name assigned by `set` or `choose` is a
session attribute.

## 3. Semantics

**Configuration.** Time; the live sessions with their attributes,
continuation (a stack of block frames), status (ready, queued at a pool,
at a stage, waiting to grow, ended) and active holds; for each pool its
capacity, the allocations of its holders (in admission order), its cache
(entries of units, release time and release order, per session or dead),
its admission queue and its growers; for each stage its jobs.

**Commands take no time**; they run whenever a session is ready, in the
order sessions became ready. Flow lets time pass at the stages. After
every event the interpreter *settles*: it runs every ready session, then
retries growers and admissions at every pool not served by a stage, until
nothing changes; then it starts an iteration on every idle step stage that
has residents or a waiting queue it serves, provided no other event is
pending at the same instant (a scheduler step sees every arrival up to it).

**Pools.** `hold m₁(u₁) fits(r₁), m₂(u₂) … reuse(ρ) { body } cache(ℓ)`
joins the queue of `m₁`. The unit expressions are evaluated *when the
session is admitted* (the lecture's `[Admit]` evaluates `c(x_r)` then;
observables such as the cache or an engine's budget change while a
session waits). The head of a queue is admitted when every pool of its hold
has room for its `fits` units next to the allocated units (`used + r ≤ cap`,
`r = max(u, fits)`; cached prefixes never block); the first that does not
fit blocks the rest (head-of-line blocking). On admission the session
consumes at most `ρ` units of its own cached prefix (`cached :=` what it
consumed); the rest of that entry stays in the cache as a *dead* entry with
the same age, unusable, until evicted; other entries are evicted in the
pool's order until allocations and cache fit; `u` units are allocated and
the body runs. At the end of the body the units are released and
`min(ℓ, computed)` units stay cached, rounded down to blocks (`computed`
is the allocation, or the position a `growing` run reached). The invariant
`allocated + cached ≤ cap` holds in every reachable configuration
(`RouteLang.Step.invariant`). `end` releases every hold but *keeps* the
session's cached prefixes: the cache does not know that a session has left
(lecture `[End]`; vLLM keeps the blocks). A program that models dropping
them writes `drop POOL;` before `end;`. Eviction is per entry, or per block
from the tail of the entry when the pool has `block b`; `evict lru` orders
by release time and then release order, `evict by (k₁, …)` by the keys and
then release order. A request that can never fit is rejected (vLLM
`FINISHED_IGNORED`).

A pool marked `admit via S` is not admitted at settle time: its queue is
served by step stage `S`, at the start of an iteration, after the
residents have taken their tokens, while the iteration has budget left, and
not in an iteration that preempted (vLLM's waiting loop,
`scheduler.py:868-1128`). `budget_left(S)` then evaluates to the budget
left. Until then a waiting session's cached prefix is evictable, which is
the *wait channel* of Lecture 5.

`grow m (d)` enlarges the innermost hold on `m` by `d` (rounded to
blocks). If it does not fit: with `preempt none` the session waits and
resumes where it was; with `preempt lifo` the most recently admitted
holder is preempted (vLLM `running[-1]`): its job leaves its stage, its
hold is released with its computed prefix cached, and it re-enters the head
of the pool's queue with the hold statement to execute again. The grower
itself can be the victim.

**Stages.** `fifo(c)`: `c` servers, jobs in arrival order at rate 1.
`ps(φ)`: every job at once, each at `φ(n)/n`. `delay`: every job on its
own at rate 1. `step { budget B; cost C; }`: an engine that runs
iterations. The residents are served in the order their sessions were
admitted (vLLM's `running` list; with `decode first` the decoding residents
first): one token to a decoding job, up to `chunk` to a prefilling one,
until the budget is spent; a `growing` job first grows its hold to the
position it will reach (block by block, preempting if needed); then the
stage admits from the queues it serves. The iteration lasts `C` seconds, an
expression in `ntok`, `ndec`, `npre`, `nres`, `kvb`, `kvp`, `attn`; its
tokens are applied when it ends. A run of zero work completes at once.
`exclusive prefill` schedules only the first prefilling resident while one
exists (the RBLN stack). Without a per-request chunk cap, serving in
admission order *is* serving decode-first (`RouteLang.Serve.serve_eq_decode_first`;
a cap breaks it, `chunk_cap_breaks_shape`), which is why the paper's
"prefill from the budget decode leaves" describes vLLM too.

**Workload.** `init` runs at arrival, `turn` at every `turn` statement;
with a `trace`, `turn` loads the next turn's `new`, `out`, `think`,
`forced` and sets `more` (`ordered`: session `i` replays trace session `i`).
Random draws use separate streams for arrivals, workload, route and
eviction.

**Statistics.** `observe x = e` records a sample after warm-up with the
time, session and turn (`--dump DIR` writes them); the report gives per
stage the time-average number present, utilisation, throughput, mean wait
and service, and per pool the time-average used, cached, queue and
holders, the mean queue wait, admissions, evictions, preemptions, spills
and rejections.

**Executable semantics in Lean.** `RouteExec.lean` defines the same rules
for the fragment of pools and one step engine on the step clock (values in
ℕ): `Exec.run` interprets a `Route Env ℕ` program for `n` sessions. It is
the semantics the oracle theorems are about.


## 4. From the lecture's version to v2

| Lecture (L1:def:syntax, L1:def:semantics) | v2 | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `admit m c` … `free m [cache ℓ]` as separate actions | `hold m (c) { … } cache (ℓ)` | balance is syntactic; preemption is "abort the scope"; the memory invariant is provable per command |
| one pool kind (KV bytes) | pools are counted resources with an optional cache: KV, request slots (`max_num_seqs`), live-session caps, offload tiers | the same guard and queue serve all of them; the lecture's "slots" remark becomes literal |
| `serial`, `shared(φ)`, `external` | `fifo(c)`, `ps(φ)`, `delay`, **`step`** | the colocated engine (Exercise L1:exr:colocated) and vLLM's chunked prefill |
| hit indicator `H ∈ {0,1}` | `cached` (units found), block-rounded | partial hits (block eviction, tail first) |
| eviction order `E` as a name | `evict lru` / `evict by (keys)` with online estimates | the priced orders of §3 are expressible |
| no growth, no preemption | `grow`, `growing`, `preempt lifo` | decode grows the KV; vLLM preempts |
| `branch_p` with a constant | `branch (expr)` | traces decide continuation |
| no measurement | `observe`, `--dump` | TTFT and the price are defined in the program |
| no routing | stage arrays and `choose` | §3.2 |

The lecture's disaggregated replica is `programs/lecture_pd.route` and,
in Lean, `RouteLang.disaggregatedReplica`; the paper's colocated
two-resource replica is `programs/replica.route` and
`RouteLang.colocatedReplica`.

## 5. Programs

| Program | Deployment | Checked against |
|---|---|---|
| `mg1.route`, `ps.route`, `closed.route` | M/G/1 FIFO, M/G/1-PS, M/M/1//N | closed forms (`route_closed_forms.rs`): M/M/1 sojourn, PK for four laws, PS insensitivity, MVA |
| `agentic.route` | `models::agentic` (one FIFO replica, finite KV, SF eviction) | hand-written model, throughput within 3 %, hit rate within 0.5 pt, response within 3 % (`route_agentic.rs`) |
| `replica.route` | the paper's two-resource replica (`TwoStage`) on the open-session scenario (`decode first`, `drop kv` before `end`) | no memory limit: TTFT 0.253 vs 0.250 s, response 0.336 vs 0.333 s; 20 seeds at 16 and 20 live sessions: hit rate, TTFT and throughput agree (Mann–Whitney p ≥ 0.05); at 24 live sessions the iteration-level engine has 10 % lower throughput and twice the mean TTFT (p = 0.017, 0.047), hit rate 0.80 vs 0.86 (p = 0.11); no seed of either engine falls below a 0.5 hit rate (`data/exp/route/replica_seeds.csv`, `route_replica_and_pd.rs`) |
| `pd_tandem.route`, `lecture_pd.route` | tandem PD, the lecture's disaggregated replica | capacity formulas within 2 %; stability |
| `routing.route` | four replicas, five policies | `models::routing` within 1–2 % on response and hit rate |
| `vllm.route` | vLLM v1 engine (Section 7) | scheduler semantics tests, the upstream oracle |
| `vllm_replay.route` | vLLM v1 on the A100 testbed replaying the short-context trace | ten measured runs (Section 8) |

## 6. The simulator uses ROUTE

`libqueuingsim` depends on `route`; `libqueuingsim/tests/route_*.rs`
run the programs above under `make sim` next to the hand-written models.
The hand-written models stay as the second implementation the programs
are checked against; new scenarios should be written as programs.

## 7. vLLM v1 as a ROUTE program

`programs/vllm.route` and `programs/vllm_replay.route` (upstream `ref/vllm`
at 0c87a197; the A100 testbed runs vLLM 0.30.0, whose scheduler gives
identical answers on the differential scenario below):

| vLLM | ROUTE | Where |
|---|---|---|
| a token budget per step, running requests first in `running` order, then waiting requests with the budget left | `step { budget B }`, residents in admission order; `pool slots { admit via engine; }` | `scheduler.py:577, 624-823, 868-1128` |
| `max_num_seqs` | `pool slots { cap max_seqs }` in the hold | `scheduler.py:877-879` |
| FCFS, head-of-line blocking (`if new_blocks is None: break`) | pool queue `fifo`; the first request that does not fit blocks | `scheduler.py:1228-1235` |
| admission needs blocks for the whole prompt (`scheduler_reserve_full_isl = True`), but only the first chunk is allocated | `kv (hit + min(prompt − hit, budget_left(engine))) fits (prompt)` | `kv_cache_manager.py:515-531`, `config/scheduler.py:191` |
| a waiting request's prefix is looked up and its blocks touched only when it is scheduled | units evaluated at admission; the queue served by the engine | `scheduler.py:932-939`, `block_pool.py:754-770` |
| chunked prefill, `long_prefill_token_threshold` | `run engine prefill (n) growing kv`, `chunk` | `scheduler.py:612-616, 675-676, 1115-1128` |
| `allocate_slots` block by block as the request advances | `growing kv` | `kv_cache_manager.py:371-608` |
| preemption of `running[-1]`, `waiting.prepend_request`, `num_computed_tokens = 0`, no admission in a step that preempted | `preempt lifo`, re-queued at the head, hold re-executed; `admit via` skips preempting iterations | `scheduler.py:742-813, 869, 1539-1582` |
| the prefix cache holds every *computed* full block, generated tokens included; a hit is the longest run of cached full blocks, at most `num_tokens − 1` | `cache (prompt + out − 1)`; `reuse (floor(min(prev prompt, prompt − 1)/bs)·bs)`; the unmatched blocks stay cached, dead | `kv_cache_manager.py:289-300, 602-606`, `single_type_kv_cache_manager.py:743-838` |
| the free queue: freed blocks appended tail first (LRU), in the order requests finish | `evict lru` per block from the tail, ties by release order | `block_pool.py:776-805`, `single_type_kv_cache_manager.py:557-585` |
| a finished session's blocks stay in the free queue | `end` keeps the cache | `block_pool.py:776-805` |
| a forced miss (a nonce at the head of the prompt) matches nothing; the old blocks stay | `reuse (0)` | trace |

Not modelled: the watermark (0 by default), the "alone" exception of the
long-prefill threshold, encoder inputs, speculative decoding, sliding
window, cross-session prefix sharing (out of scope), asynchronous
scheduling (Section 8).

**How the correspondence is checked.** Three oracles, all agreeing:

1. *Deterministic scenarios* (`route/tools/oracle/*.json`): the real
   scheduler driven by a fake model runner (`vllm_oracle.py`), the real
   A100 engine with Qwen3-8B stepped by hand (`a100_engine.json`,
   `scripts/exp/lambda/route_cases.py`), the ROUTE program
   (`route/tests/vllm_oracle.rs`) and the Lean executable semantics
   (`RouteOracle.lean`, one theorem per scenario, `decide +kernel`) give
   the same first-token step, last-token step and preemption count for every
   request (6 scenarios: self-preemption, chunked prefill sharing the
   budget, the request cap, head-of-line blocking, the chunk cap, six mixed
   requests with staggered arrivals on 39 blocks).
2. *The trace at full scale* (`vllm_replay_oracle.py`,
   `scripts/exp/diff_route_vllm.sh`): the real scheduler and KV-cache
   manager replay the 333-session short-context trace with the trace's
   token ids, on the same clock as ROUTE. ROUTE and the scheduler agree on
   every request's send time, first-token time and cached tokens: 3 321 of
   3 321, for a constant step cost and for the A100 cost model, on the
   base and the forced-miss traces, and on 40-session runs with 1 000,
   1 500 and 3 000 blocks (both deadlock at the same step on 1 000 blocks).
   The same scenario on vLLM 0.30.0's scheduler gives the same answers.
3. The search for the first differing step (`first_divergence.sh`) found
   the six semantic differences the first version of the program had
   (`docs/route-review.md` §3).

## 8. vLLM on the A100 testbed

`programs/vllm_replay.route` replays the short-context trace of
`docs/testbed-gpu.md` (Qwen3-8B, block 16, budget 512, `max_num_seqs` 64,
128 160-token pool, prefix caching; session `i` sent at `i·spacing`, turn
`k+1` `think` seconds after turn `k`).

**Engine cost, measured.** 3 022 steps of the A100 engine stepped by hand
(decode batches of 1–64 at contexts 256–32k, prefill chunks at contexts
0–32k; `route/tools/a100/steps.jsonl`, `scripts/exp/lambda/route_cases.py`)
fit `c + d·ndec + e·kvb + a·npre + b·attn` with MAPE 2.7 % (decode), 5.6 %
(prefill), 5.7 % (mixed): c = 13.9 ms, d = 41 µs, e = 0.138 µs, a = 51.5
µs, b = 4.02 ns (`route/tools/a100/step_fit.json`). The same `a` and `b`
explain the light-load one-chunk TTFTs of the served runs (slope 74 µs per
new token ≈ a + b·K̄).

**Why the first version under-predicted misses.** Not timing: the real
scheduler replayed on ROUTE's clock loses *more* prefixes than the
testbed. The first program pinned waiting requests' prefixes, cached only
prompts, dropped finished sessions' blocks and differed in three smaller
rules (§7, `docs/route-review.md` §3). With those fixed, the program and
the scheduler agree request for request.

**Two overhead constants.** What the served path adds (asynchronous
scheduling overlaps CPU work with the GPU; the API server tokenises the
text prompt) is two constants, `c_it` per step and `c0` per request.
Fitted on the two light-load runs only (`scripts/exp/calibrate_route.py`,
grid 4–14 ms × 0–40 ms, `data/exp/route/calibration.txt`: c_it = 4 ms,
c0 = 40 ms), the held-out runs are predicted as follows:

| run | TTFT measured / model (s) | full-hit measured / model |
|---|---|---|
| 5 s (fit) | 0.177 / 0.168 | 0.966 / 0.947 |
| 4.2 s (fit) | 0.236 / 0.264 | 0.935 / 0.878 |
| 3.5 s, two seeds | 0.507, 0.473 / 0.422 | 0.839, 0.840 / 0.821 |
| 3.0 s | 0.473 / 0.605 | 0.828 / 0.775 |
| 2.5 s (collapsed) | 34.6 / 39.1 | 0.216 / 0.192 |
| 4.2 s, 10 % forced | 0.627 / 0.576 | 0.769 / 0.732 |
| 3.5 s, 10 % forced, two seeds | 0.886, 1.122 / 0.795, 0.838 | 0.736, 0.724 / 0.712, 0.713 |
| 2.5 s, 10 % forced (collapsed) | 41.8 / 49.6 | 0.089 / 0.104 |

The ridge is flat: on a wider grid the light-load optimum moves to c_it = 0,
c0 = 60 ms, which fits the light runs better (mean |log ratio| 0.033 against
0.084) and the loaded runs worse (2.5 s: 14 s against 35 s measured). The
light-load data alone do not identify the split; the served step trace
(below) is what identifies it.

**The measured replica is on the cliff at 3 s.** The 3.0 s run of
2026-09-26 did not collapse (full-hit 0.83, TTFT 0.47 s); the rerun of
2026-09-27 with per-iteration logging on (which slowed the 3.5 s run by
30 %: TTFT 0.68 against 0.51 s) collapsed (full-hit 0.20, TTFT 32 s). The
same workload on the same engine flips with a small change in per-step
cost, as the feedback of Lecture 5 predicts at the edge.

**Hypothesis H-pin, on the real scheduler.** Pinning a waiting request's
cached prefix at arrival (`scripts/exp/lambda/steptrace/pinpatch.py`,
released once the scheduler admits it) and replaying the trace at 3.0 s
through the real scheduler on the A100 cost clock: full-hit 0.43 → 0.80,
mean TTFT 20 s → 0.72 s (`--pin` of `vllm_replay_oracle.py`). ROUTE
predicted the same with a one-line change of the program (no `admit via`):
0.80.

**Served step trace** (`scripts/exp/lambda/steptrace/sitecustomize.py`:
the time of every `schedule()` and `update_from_output()` of the served
engine with the step's composition; `data/exp/gpu_route/trace/`). With
this light tracer instead of the stats logger the 3.0 s replay does not
collapse: full-hit 0.832, mean TTFT 0.441 s (2026-09-26: 0.828, 0.473 s),
so the logger's overhead is what pushed the earlier rerun over the cliff.
Median served step periods are 18.7 ms (decode only) and 42 ms (a
512-token prefill chunk), against 14 ms and 41–50 ms stepped by hand; a
regression of served periods on the step quantities is too noisy to
identify the constants (MAPE 25–56 %), so the calibrated pair
(c_it, c0) = (4 ms, 40 ms) is an effective light-load calibration, not a
decomposition of the served path.

**Pre-registered predictions** (`data/exp/route/prereg/predictions.txt`,
written before the traced runs finished; the pinned variant is the same
program without `admit via engine`):

## 9. Known limitations

* Continuous work and fluid rates at `fifo`/`ps`/`delay` stages; the
  `step` stage is discrete. The paper's `TwoStage` fluid server is the
  step stage with the budget filled to the memory time; at ω = 0.2 ms
  that is 5 000 iterations per simulated second, so long horizons are
  slow (a `fluid` option for the step stage is the natural extension).
* Cache entries are per session; cross-session prefix sharing (a common
  system prompt) needs a content-addressed cache, not written yet.
* One eviction order per pool; the priced orders use `price(stage, …)`
  with the stage's online estimates, as `libqueuingsim` does.
* The Lean model covers the syntax, the pool semantics and the stage
  rates; the step stage and the session-level semantics (continuations,
  flow) are not formalised yet, and there is no proof that the Rust
  interpreter implements the Lean relation (the vLLM oracle and the
  closed-form checks are the evidence; `docs/route-review.md` §4 lists
  the tools that would close this gap).
